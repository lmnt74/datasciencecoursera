This was mostly an exercise in cleaning up data. 

Took the dataset that was provided by UCI and cleaned it up. The data set they provided was scattered through various folders.

Raw Data:
Volunteer and volunteer activity
Various measurements are included in different files broken up into training sets and test sets. (more details in features.txt)

We took the volunteers and linked them to the activities they performed, along with some statistics that were provided on their
activities. We merged both the training and test data sets. Then pulled all the mean and standard deviations of their activiites.
There were a total of 30 volunteers and the activities they performed were broken into six categories:
Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying

The standard deviation and means were then averaged by activity and volunteer to give the final output which, if you would
like you can write to a file by uncommentig the last piece of code.
